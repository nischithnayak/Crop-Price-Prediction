This project leverages data from the AgriConnect government website, which provides prices of various commodities like onions, arecanuts, tomatoes, coconuts, etc. The data is converted into a CSV file and used to train an artificial neural network model.

The system predicts the modal price (Rs./Quintal) for a selected commodity in specific markets (e.g., Udupi, Davangere, Belgaum, etc.) based on user input (year, month, day). The output includes predicted prices for the selected markets and a visual representation using a bar graph.

Key technologies used:

Data scraping and preprocessing
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predictions
Python libraries for data analysis and visualization
Steps included:

Data collection from AgriConnect.
Data transformation to CSV.
ANN model training for price prediction.
User input for specific date predictions.
Output predictions in a tabular format and bar graph.
